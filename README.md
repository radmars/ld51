Radmars's entry into Ludum Dare 51's Jam.

# TODO

-   Giving the laser a reasonable bounding box
-   Radmars intro screen
-   Victory screen
-   Come up with name for game (360 Micro-scope?)
-   Increase visibility of player
-   Particle effects

-   unfreeze should probably be on a timer and not on 10s tick
-   spacebar for laser?
-   make sure background is black & game is centered on itch.io page or wherever the heck we embed it
